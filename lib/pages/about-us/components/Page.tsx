            Gamejitsu is an idea hatched to fill the current gap in the e-sport coaching industry in
            terms of customizability.

          <ParagraphTitle>Goal</ParagraphTitle>
          <ParagraphText>
            As most coaches are focusing on video / live coaching, we realized that the only
            possible way currently to learn and improve at your own tempo is to repeatedly watch
            your own replays, and that is both boring and difficult because you might not realise
            your own mistakes. Live coaching might not be suitable for all. Playing at a high level
            requires a good player to focus on multiple things at a time, and a coach talking
            alongside is definitely not helping.
