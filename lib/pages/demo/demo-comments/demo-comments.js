    text: `# The Draft\n- Looking at the draft itself, your team should have good lane matchups in all 3 lanes. Juggernaut doesn't care about a Venomancer in the laning phase, Zeus can lane well against Sniper and start pressuring the lane at higher levels, and Bristleback against Wraith King is as easy as ABC. In fact, your team stands a chance to come out of the laning phase winning all 3 of them. However, your team will struggle lategame-wise, as your team doesn't have a natural gap-closer to deal with a Sniper, only relying on your Zeus' Nimbus to lock him down and jump on him. In fact, without a Blink Dagger on Juggernaut, it is not likely that your team will have any follow-up damage to Zeus' Nimbus, hence your team should try and end the game early, abusing the fact that your Bristleback is a midgame monster going highground, especially when coupled with Bounty Hunter giving vision on the enemy Pudge and your Juggernaut providing a Healing Ward.\n\nJudging on the enemy draft:\n- The Wraith King can probably only be a position 1\n- The Sniper can probably only be a position 2\n- Pudge and Shadow Shaman can be a 4 or 5\n- Pudge and Venomancer may also be a 3 or 4\n- If the draft goes extra weird, they might put a Venomancer mid against Zeus (Which is actually disadvantageous for your team), place a Sniper carry and a Wraith King offlane. However, such a draft will have a huge imbalance in resource planning because Sniper and Wraith King both needs farm, while Venomancer, who does not need that much farm, is placed in a weird position 2.

    text: `## Draft advantages\n- As a position 4 Lina in this game against a melee carry such as a Wraith King and a position 5 support with short range, Lina pos 4 excels extremely well in the lane unless you place yourself out of position. This however, should not happen because your lane partner is a Bristleback, who is tanky enough to attract attention at the frontlines.\n- Your team has a Zeus as an answer to Sniper, namely Aghanims Zeus. Bounty Hunter is also an annoyance towards Sniper and Pudge, because both of them do not like having their positions exposed and Track is exactly the issue for them.\n- In the laning stage, Juggernaut doesn't care about Pudge and Venomancer unless he places himself in terrible positions and get himself hooked into towers.\n- The enemy doesn't really have a natural answer to deal with Zeus, as none of their heroes comes with innate gap-closing abilities.\n\n\n## Draft disadvantages\n- The Pudge, despite being a position 4 Pudge who is generally worthless, can turn teamfights or skirmishes around because almost all of your heroes are easy hook targets, namely Juggernaut, Zeus and Lina.\n- Venomancer and Shadow Shaman will be an issue for the Bristleback as they can kite and disable him to no end in teamfights, depending on whether the enemy team is smart enough to disable but at the same time don't focus their primary damage-dealing on the Bristleback itself.\n- Your team does not have a reliable answer regarding the issue of protecting Zeus.\n- Your Bounty Hunter does not provide disables for your Juggernaut to utilize his Bladefury well in the lane. In fact, you probably should switch roles or at least, lanes with the Bounty Hunter, as Lina's Light Strike Array provides a decent stun for Juggernaut, especially against slow targets like a Pudge.\n- Bounty Hunter as a position 5 doesn't make much sense, considering he earns gold quickly and wants to roam instead of wanting to babysit a carry.`,

    text: `### How you should be playing Lina position 4 in this game\n- Ideally, you should be laning with the Juggernaut this game because you can provide a stun for Juggernaut's Bladefury.\n- However, laning with Bristleback is great for a Lina as well, just the unfortunate fact that Juggernaut doesn't really benefit much from a Bounty Hunter position 5.\n- Sniper can be a potential gank target when your Zeus is level 6, or level 5 (If he maxes Lighting Bolt, which is currently uncommon due to the fact that Arc Lightning is too cost-effective now as a spell.)\n- You should be focusing on harassing both the Wraith King and Shadow Shaman during the laning phase. In fact, Shadow Shaman is a super easy target to kill, especially if your Bristleback takes an early level in Nasal Goo.\n- An Euls Scepter pickup will be great this game, because you can interrupt Rhasta's Shackles, Pudge's Dismember and even Sniper's Assassinate. It also serves as a great long-range initiation tool, especially on the pesky Sniper. You should start a fight by Cycloning a target, have both you and Bristleback close in, follow up with Light Strike Array and everything else. With this item, your pickoff ability with Bristleback will be greatly increased and almost no one (sans Wraith King) will be able to farm safely alone.\n- Key targets you want to watch out for in teamfights will be both the Sniper and Pudge. If you go out of position and get caught by a hook you're basically done, and if you get caught in Sniper's Shrapnel and get focused on you will most likely die to Assassinate as well (Pray you have Euls to save yourself in that case)\n- You probably do not have to play as a waveclear in this game, notably because your team is full of waveclears such as Juggernaut, Zeus and Bristleback all 3 being resource hoggers. Hence, you might end up with lesser farm, unless you profit tremendously in teamfights or skirmishes. To do that, you want Sniper as your food source.\n- In lategame teamfights, you want to stand behind your Bristleback and Juggernaut, saving your Euls to disrupt either Shadow Shaman's Shackles or Pudge's Dismember on your cores.`,

    text: `### Item loadout\n\nYou can consider grabbing a Blight Stone this game as your loadout. Blight Stone is a great item on Lina as her base damage is pretty high, plus the fact that you have a Bristleback who both relies on physical damage and has Nasal Goo as armor reduction as well, stacking extremely well with your Blight Stone."`,

    text: `### Starting ward\n\nRegarding this starting ward, it doesn't make much sense to place it in this position. \nThis is considered a (bad) defensive ward, because it covers vision in your lane. In retrospect, you should be placing wards deeper in the enemy jungle.\n\n- Good defensive wards are wards where you can see both the enemy small camp (and ideally the large camp too) + the river ramp to your left, so you can spot incoming ganks from the enemy mid. Recommended if the enemy mid is a strong roaming hero.\n- Good offensive wards are wards where you can see both the enemy small camp and the enemy safelane / tower vision. This is used when you have a strong offlane duo against a weak safelane duo, and you have the potential to dive towers.`,

    text: `## Your first death\n\nLet's do a quick recap:\n- You died while trying to extend your advantage on harassing Wraith King, considering you threw all your spells for Fiery Soul stacks.\n\nHowever, winning the lane doesn't mean you harass the enemies until they die. Harassing, is actually just trying to keep the enemy HP low enough so he doesn't have the HP to contest whatever you are trying to do. This may mean:\n- Controlling the creep equilibrium so your Bristleback can farm safely and deny the Wraith King's farm.\n- Do side lane pulls. If the enemy HP are all low, if they contest they may die.\n- The enemy couldn't roam and gank lanes if they are low on health. In comparison, you can do that better, because you know low HP heroes wouldn't be jumping on your Bristleback soon even if you leave him alone to gank mid.\n\nYou generally don't harass people to death, you kill people by harassing them and keeping their HP unhealthy, then force them to contest for something, such as a side pull. Either they lose a full creepwave worth of farm to your pull, or they try to contest it and risk dying, which also means **they lose a full creepwave worth of farm (at least) and their heads.**`,
