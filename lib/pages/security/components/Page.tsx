              <ParagraphTitle>Our security philosophy</ParagraphTitle>
              We recognize how important it is to help protect privacy and security. We understand
              that secure products and services are critical in establishing and maintaining trust
              with our users. We strive to consistently deliver secure and enjoyable experiences in
              all of our products and services. Security includes everyone. Our users, our coaches,
              our developers, third party software developers and the security community. Working
              together we can all make Steam and the Internet safer.
              <ParagraphTitle>Reporting security issues</ParagraphTitle>
              Security of our networks and services is important for us and for you. We take it
              seriously. If you are a user or a coach and have a security issue to report regarding
              your personal account, please contact us. This includes password problems, login
              issues, suspected fraud and account abuse issues. If you have discovered a
              vulnerability in Gamejitsu and/or a Gamejitsu product or have a security incident to
              report, we encourage you to submit a report to our email. You may instead send email
              describing the issue to{" "}
              <LinkMailBold href="mailto:support@gamejitsu.gg">support@gamejitsu.gg</LinkMailBold>.
              If you feel the need, please use our public key to encrypt your communications with
              us. We believe in responsible security disclosure practices. In accordance with this
              we appreciate reporters privately notifying us of vulnerabilities and setting
              reasonable time frames for response and disclosure based on the severity of the issue.
              We believe this method provides the most secure environment for users and coaches and
              the Internet at large. We will respond as soon as we can to fix verifiable security
              issues. When notified of legitimate issues, we will acknowledge your report, begin
              investigating the issue and will work to correct any vulnerabilities quickly.
